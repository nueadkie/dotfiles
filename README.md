# Personal Dotfiles

Contains a `.bashrc` with alias for `g='git'` and `python='python3'`. May break python2. 

## Requirements

Assumes `powerline-go` has been installed into `$HOME/go/bin/powerline-go`. This should be the case after following the installation directions in <https://github.com/justjanne/powerline-go>. 
The go package `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` may be missing by default, so `go get gopkg.in/yaml.v2` may need to be run.
